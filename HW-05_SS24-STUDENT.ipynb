    "Image segmentation is a critical process in computer vision that involves dividing an image into multiple segments or parts to make the image more meaningful and easier to analyze. At its core, image segmentation aims to assign a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. This technique enables the identification of boundaries and objects within images, paving the way for more advanced image analysis and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications, image segmentation plays a pivotal role in numerous fields, including medical imaging, autonomous driving, and object detection. By accurately segmenting an image into its constituent parts, we can isolate and analyze specific regions of interest, enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of image processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the homework, you will delve into the practical application of image segmentation using 2D and 3D arrays. By leveraging your knowledge of array manipulation, you will create a visually appealing representation of an image, demonstrating the power of image segmentation techniques. The goal is to not only reinforce your understanding of 2D and 3D arrays but also to showcase how these fundamental concepts are applied in the field of computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning Outcome: By the end of this part, you should be able to apply basic image segmentation techniques to manipulate and analyze images. This will be a stepping stone towards understanding more complex image processing tasks.\n",

    "- Task: Utilizing the provided image of Sparty, you will apply segmentation techniques to isolate specific features or segments of the image, creating a unique visual effect that highlights your understanding of the concept.\n",
